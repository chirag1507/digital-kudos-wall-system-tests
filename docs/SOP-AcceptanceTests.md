# Standard Operating Procedure: Acceptance Tests

**Status:** Mandatory  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** {{CURRENT_DATE}}

## Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the non-negotiable standards for implementing acceptance tests in the Digital Kudos Wall project. These standards ensure that our acceptance tests remain maintainable, scalable, and focused on WHAT rather than HOW, following Dave Farley's four-layer testing model.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all acceptance tests implemented in the `digital-kudos-wall-system-tests` repository.

## Non-Negotiable Standards

### 1. Four-Layer Architecture

All acceptance tests MUST follow Dave Farley's four-layer model:

1. **Business Layer (Features)**

   - MUST be written in Gherkin syntax
   - MUST focus on business behavior, not implementation
   - MUST use ubiquitous language from the domain
   - MUST be stored in `/src/acceptance/features`
   - MUST NOT contain technical details or implementation specifics

   Example:

   ```gherkin
   Feature: User Registration
     As a new user
     I want to register for an account
     So that I can access the kudos wall

     Scenario: Successful registration
       Given I am on the registration page
       When I register with valid details:
         | name     | email           | password     |
         | John Doe | john@example.com| SecurePass1! |
       Then I should be redirected to the login page
       And I should receive a confirmation email
   ```

2. **Test Layer (Step Definitions)**

   - MUST be stored in `/src/acceptance/step_definitions`
   - MUST use only DSL methods
   - MUST NOT contain direct driver interactions
   - MUST map Gherkin steps to DSL calls
   - MUST be focused on orchestrating test steps

   Example:

   ```typescript
   import { Given, When, Then } from "@cucumber/cucumber";
   import { RegistrationDSL } from "../dsl/registration.dsl";

   Given("I am on the registration page", async function () {
     await this.registrationDSL.navigateToRegistration();
   });

   When("I register with valid details:", async function (dataTable) {
     const details = dataTable.hashes()[0];
     await this.registrationDSL.registerUser(details);
   });
   ```

3. **DSL Layer (Domain-Specific Language)**

   - MUST be stored in `/src/acceptance/dsl`
   - MUST provide business-focused methods
   - MUST abstract away technical implementation details
   - MUST use driver layer for interactions
   - MUST be reusable across multiple test scenarios

   Example:

   ```typescript
   export class RegistrationDSL {
     constructor(private registrationPage: AccountRegistrationPage) {}

     async navigateToRegistration(): Promise<void> {
       await this.registrationPage.navigate();
     }

     async registerUser(details: RegistrationDetails): Promise<void> {
       await this.registrationPage.registerUser(details);
     }

     async verifyRegistrationSuccess(): Promise<boolean> {
       return this.registrationPage.isRegistrationSuccessful();
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Driver Layer**

   - MUST be stored in `/src/acceptance/drivers`
   - MUST handle all direct interactions with the system
   - MUST encapsulate technical implementation details
   - MUST be the only layer aware of the technical stack
   - MUST provide clean interfaces for the DSL layer
   - MUST implement Page Objects for web UI interactions
   - MUST define clear interfaces for each driver
   - MUST allow multiple implementations of the same interface

   Example Driver Interface:

   ```typescript
   export interface AccountRegistrationDriver {
     /**
      * Check if the registration service is healthy and available
      */
     checkServiceHealth(): Promise<void>;

     /**
      * Create a test user for verification purposes
      * @param details Registration details
      */
     createTestUser(details: RegistrationDetails): Promise<void>;

     /**
      * Register a new user
      * @param details Registration details
      */
     register(details: RegistrationDetails): Promise<RegistrationResult>;

     /**
      * Verify if a confirmation email was sent
      * @param email Email to check for confirmation
      */
     verifyConfirmationEmail(email: string): Promise<boolean>;

     /**
      * Clean up any test data
      */
     cleanup(): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

   Example Page Object (Web UI Implementation):

   ```typescript
   export class AccountRegistrationPage extends BasePage {
     async registerUser(details: RegistrationDetails): Promise<void> {
       await this.page.getByTestId("name-input").fill(details.name);
       await this.page.getByTestId("email-input").fill(details.email);
       await this.page.getByTestId("password-input").fill(details.password);
       await this.page.getByTestId("register-button").click();
     }

     async isRegistrationSuccessful(): Promise<boolean> {
       try {
         await this.page.waitForURL("**/login", { timeout: 5000 });
         return true;
       } catch (error) {
         return false;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Example API Driver Implementation:

   ```typescript
   export class ApiAccountRegistrationDriver implements AccountRegistrationDriver {
     constructor(private apiClient: ApiClient) {}

     async checkServiceHealth(): Promise<void> {
       await this.apiClient.get("/health");
     }

     async register(details: RegistrationDetails): Promise<RegistrationResult> {
       const response = await this.apiClient.post("/register", details);
       return {
         success: response.status === 201,
         message: response.data.message,
       };
     }

     async verifyConfirmationEmail(email: string): Promise<boolean> {
       const response = await this.apiClient.get(`/emails/${email}/confirmation`);
       return response.data.sent === true;
     }

     async cleanup(): Promise<void> {
       // Cleanup implementation
     }

     async createTestUser(details: RegistrationDetails): Promise<void> {
       await this.apiClient.post("/test-users", details);
     }
   }
   ```

### 2. Page Object Pattern

All web UI interactions MUST follow the Page Object pattern:

- MUST be stored in `/src/acceptance/drivers/web/pages`
- MUST extend `BasePage` class
- MUST encapsulate all page-specific selectors and interactions
- MUST provide high-level methods for page operations
- MUST handle low-level WebDriver interactions
- MUST implement proper wait strategies
- MUST use data-testid attributes for element selection

### 3. Test Organization

#### Feature Files

- MUST follow `<feature>/<scenario>.feature` structure
- MUST use declarative language
- MUST focus on business value
- MUST include clear acceptance criteria
- MUST NOT contain technical implementation details

Example directory structure:

```
features/
  ├── registration/
  │   ├── successful_registration.feature
  │   └── validation_errors.feature
  └── kudos/
      ├── give_kudos.feature
      └── receive_kudos.feature
```

#### Step Definitions

- MUST be organized by feature or domain concept
- MUST use clear, descriptive method names
- MUST call only DSL methods
- MUST handle test data setup and teardown
- MUST NOT contain business logic

#### DSL Methods

- MUST represent business operations
- MUST be named using ubiquitous language
- MUST be reusable across scenarios
- MUST abstract technical complexity
- MUST NOT expose implementation details

#### Drivers

- MUST be interface-based
- MUST be replaceable without changing higher layers
- MUST handle all system interaction details
- MUST implement error handling
- MUST be technology-specific

### 4. Code Quality Standards

#### Clean Code Principles

- MUST follow SOLID principles

- MUST log relevant information for debugging

### 5. Test Data Management

#### Test Data Creation

- MUST use test data builders

- MUST allow override of specific attributes
- MUST create minimal required data

Example:

```typescript
export class UserBuilder {
  private data: Partial<UserData> = {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    password: "SecurePass1!",
  };

  withEmail(email: string): this {
    this.data.email = email;
    return this;
  }

  build(): UserData {
    return { ...this.data } as UserData;
  }
}
```

#### Data Cleanup

- MUST clean up test data after execution
- MUST handle cleanup failures gracefully
- MUST log cleanup failures
- MUST not affect other tests on cleanup failure
- MUST implement cleanup in teardown hooks

#### Data Isolation

- MUST be isolated from other tests

- MUST handle concurrent test execution

### 6. Configuration Management

#### Environment Configuration

- MUST use environment-specific configuration
- MUST store sensitive data securely
- MUST be configurable for different environments
- MUST NOT hardcode environment-specific values
- MUST use configuration from `/src/config`

Example:

```typescript
export const CONFIG = {
  baseUrl: process.env.BASE_URL || "http://localhost:3000",
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  timeout: parseInt(process.env.TIMEOUT || "5000"),
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || "test",
};
```

#### Security

- MUST NOT commit sensitive data
- MUST use environment variables for secrets
- MUST validate configuration at startup
- MUST fail fast on missing required configuration
- MUST log configuration issues clearly

### 7. Shared Resources

#### Common Utilities

- MUST be stored in `/src/shared`
- MUST be properly documented
- MUST be reviewed for reusability
- MUST NOT contain test-specific logic
- MUST follow single responsibility principle

#### Base Classes

- MUST provide common functionality
- MUST be well documented
- MUST be extensible
- MUST follow SOLID principles
- MUST have clear responsibilities

Example:

```typescript
export abstract class BasePage {
  constructor(protected page: Page) {}

  abstract waitForPageLoad(): Promise<void>;

  protected async waitForElement(selector: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.page.waitForSelector(selector);
  }
}
```
